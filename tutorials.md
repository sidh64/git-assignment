I am Kamalvir Kaur.I studied all main git tutorials including branching,merging, rebasing and many more. 
It was easy to solve all the questions as instructions were clear and concise from basic to advance levels.
 I learnt all the basics of git in an easy manner but if we want to check some step it will start again from beginning.
Dear Professor,

I am writing to provide you with my review of the Git tutorial that I have created. My name is Sidharth Muraleedharan and I am a student in your class.

The Git tutorial that I have created covers the basics of version control and the features of Git that make it such a powerful tool for managing source code. The tutorial is written in a clear and concise manner, with step-by-step instructions and examples
